  - Current, previous, and same-day-last-month subscriber counts and voice usage.
  - DoD% (Day-over-Day %) and MoM% (Month-over-Month %) for both Network and OTT usage.
  - DoD% and MoM% are for Current day vs Previous day, and Current day vs Same-Day-Last-Month.
  - Cards showing MTD (Month-to-Date) and LMTD (Last-Month-to-Date) minute usage for Network and OTT.
  - MTD vs LMTD trend comparison for subscribers and voice usage.

## How It Works

- Data can be updated **only in the `Data` tab**.
- All other tabs are **protected** to prevent accidental modification of formulas.
- Once you add or update data in the `Data` tab, the report will refresh **dynamically**.
